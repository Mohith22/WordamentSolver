Wordament Solver 

Wordament is a famous puzzle game developed by microsoft which you can find in Google store or App store.  It is a 4*4 grid.  You need to swipe the characters which make meaningful words.  Points are given according to the complexity and lenght of each word.


Run the program and enter the characters row wise. 
(Fill all characters in a row and go for next..)


Problems :

- If same word can be obtained in different ways, then all of them  are shown. Instead we need only one.

- In wordament some times each grid will contain two characters. So modify the program to solve this problem.
