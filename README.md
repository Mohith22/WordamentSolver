Wordament Solver 

Wordament is a famous puzzle game developed by microsoft which you can find in Google store or App store.  It is a 4*4 grid.  You need to swipe the characters which make meaningful words.  Points are given according to the complexity and lenght of each word.


Run the program and enter the characters row wise. 
(Fill all characters in a row and go for next..)


Problems :


- if suppose there is no word starting with a particular prefix then we can ignore the prefix for furthermore calculations(words of greater length with same prefix)

- implement using OCR
